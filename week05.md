## The Art of Interactive Design by Chris Crawford & The Media Art Pose by Golan Levin

This week's reading was "What Exactly is Interactivity?", the first chapter of *The Art of Interactive Design* by Chris Crawford. In this chapter the author gives a practical definition of interactivity, discusses some things that are not interactive and draws distinctions between interactivity design, interface design and graphic design.

I actually liked how the author defines interactivity "in terms of a conversation: a cyclic process in which two actors alternately listen, think, and speak". This is very aligned with this week's optional readings by Hugh Dubberly, [*What is Interaction?*](https://www.dubberly.com/articles/what-is-interaction.html) and [*What is Conversation?*](https://www.dubberly.com/articles/what-is-conversation.html). It sounds like they are all influenced by the cybernetics... but I like Dubberly's approach and explanation better. It more quickly gets to the distinctions about different kinds of interactions. Another thing I like more about Dubberly's texts is that they introduce the ideas of "models", "feedbacks" and "self-regulation" (or learning) right away.

In this chapter Crawford only gets to say that there are different degrees of interactivity, but doesn't develop this idea much further. He very annoyingly gives long lists and arguments as to why certain things aren't interactive, while making lots of bad-to-awful jokes. I completely disagree that dancing is not interactive. When dancing to live music, it's common for the musicians to be affected by the crowd.

This text made me think of programming because programming interactivity becomes the act of teaching the computer how to "listen", "think" and "speak". It's quite poetic and motivating to think about programming this way.

Another part of the text that I thought was interesting was learning how the history of user interface design is connected to human factors studies and how to optimize actions and movements when using machines. I think there's still a lot of this present in digital interfaces and interactivity design, where apps and websites have been optimized to suit the needs of the companies that own them.

The second text, Golan Levin's short essay *Hands Up! A Visual Essay on the 'Media Art Pose'*, can be seen as a satirical take on the concept (or degree) of interactivity in media art pieces. Like Crawford mentioned, there are degrees of interactivity, and both authors would agree that the level of interactivity is low on some of these art pieces. Not because of the programmed part, which in many cases does a good job at listening, thinking and speaking, but from the part of the humans, which end conditioned to "say" the same thing while in front of different works.
