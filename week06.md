## W. E. B. Du Bois's Data Portraits: Visualizing Black America, org. by Britt Rusert and Whitney Battle-Baptiste

There are so many things to say about W. E. B. Du Bois's Data Portraits.

The book collects some essays about, and all of the 60+ data visualization plates from W.E.B. Du Bois's contribution to an exhibition at the *Exposition Universelle* in Paris in 1900, that was meant to showcase the progress made by African Americans since emancipation.

The data visualization is impressive not just for the content, context and design, but also for the multidisciplinary work of math, design, sociology, statistics, etc. I don't know if it's due to my ignorance about history, but I was surprised that people were collecting and sharing this kind of data in the 19th century.

In the Introduction, the author mentions that in these visualization, Du Bois used clean lines, bright colors and minimalist style â€œin opposition to the deeply allegorical and intentionally convoluted language that Du Bois deployed in his writings to convey the structures of oppression, alienation, and isolation under Jim Crow segregation".

This was curious in many ways. First, I read some of his essays back in freshman year of college, but I don't remember anything about Du Bois's style, so now I am intrigued and want to read more of his works. Second, I'm not sure if I totally agree with the author. Well, yes, the graphics are clean and stark, sometimes bright, but they are not all straightforward, and some aren't even straight. And linking them to this observation about his writing adds another layer of complexity and interpretation.

Many, if not most, of the visualizations use bar charts, but then we get things like Plates 11, 17, 25, 26 and 62, which are bar charts, but with curves. I don't even know how to describe Plate 11, and all of these require a couple of takes to comprehend. It's like they're breaking the expectations of straight bar charts by curving.

Plates 14 and 23 have a unique crisscross design that I have never seen before, and similarly, plate 22 is also a very unique circle graph that has something like an arrowhead shape to emphasize the numbers. Again, I think there's something here that's about breaking with the expectations, and purposefully making the data a little more challenging to read.

And, finally, I think plates 31 and 42 have a very contemporary, almost digital, aspect. Plate 31 almost has pop-ups, and 42 has some non-obvious scaling and relative proportions that, again, make it trickier to read, in a challenging way.
