## Glitch Feminism: A Manifesto by Legacy Russell

This week our reading was the Introduction chapter for Glitch Feminism by Legacy Russell written in 2020. The intro chapter speaks about the author's experience with the internet in the early 2000s and how the internet (and technology) can provide openings, or glitches, for performing more fluid and expansive identities.

This is related to other texts because it also makes a case for a more active participation in technology, but unlike the previous texts, this was written by a queer, Black, female writer, and provides a different perspective about the possibilities of the digital. "*This book is for those who are en route to becoming their avatars, those who continue to play, experiment, and build via the Internet as a means of strengthening the loop between online and AFK*".

I like how the author uses the idea of "glitch" (a computer error or malfunction) as a strategy to avoid performing constrictive binary roles inside and outside of a computer. According to my understanding, and related to previous texts, this "glitch" can be seen as a kind of materialization of other possibilities that weren't programmed into a software or into a society. So "*the glitch creates a fissure within which new possibilities of being and becoming manifest*".

I also liked the part of the text that talks about "female", "queer" and "black" as technologies that "*demand the creation of their individual machinery that innovates, builds, resists*" and malfunction and disrupt. The concept of the body and its prescribed identities as a form of technology reminds me of Foucault and technologies of control, but the way Legacy Russell makes a connection to hackable and glitch-able technologies was a new concept for me.

Overall, this text, and the idea of glitch in general, makes me think about how there are many more technologies beyond the dominant, or "correct" technologies. And just because a technology is not part of the dominant narrative, it doesn't mean it's not a technology.

The reading was a nice prologue to the [Cyberfeminism Index](https://cyberfeminismindex.com/about/). The Index has many, many, many entries about not only feminism and gender, but in a more general way, entries that talk about other histories of technology and science. The entries I selected for [my personal collection](./assets/week03/cyberfeminism-index-hersan.pdf) include texts from Sadie Plant, Donna Haraway and Chela Sandoval about histories of technology, and also some entries from the Critical Art Ensemble, an early (1990s) critical media art collective that explored digital and biological means of communications in their projects.
