## Program Or Be Programmed by Douglas Rushkoff

Program Or Be Programmed is a book about media literacy written in 2010 by the media theorist Douglas Rushkoff. In the book, Rushkoff presents 10 "commands" not just to improve how we engage with technology, but to improve how we think about creating technology.

Right in the beginning he writes something that really made me stop and think: "_Computers and networks are more than mere tools: They are like living things, themselves_". Initially I understood this to mean that technology projects are never done, they're always evolving, but I then also understood that it could mean that like other living things computers and networks evolve and grow to take shapes and meanings that are not always predictable.

I really liked his resumed history of media where he says that media "revolutions" tend to create more consumers than producers, and, like him, this is why I think it's important to learn how to program, or at least learn where programs and networks come from, what they're made of, who owns them, etc. Personally, this is why I started teaching programming and electronics to artists in Brazil back in 2010 (same year the book came out).

After reading the intro, the "commands" feel like strategies for protecting us from the biases of technologies. The ones that seemed more important to me as a creator were `III: You May Always Choose None of the Above` and `V: One Size Does Not Fit All`. I think they are related in the sense that when we create projects/experiences/stories for others we should always keep in mind our personal experiences and those of others, and allow people to not participate if they don't want to. It's important to provide an exit.

Command `VIII: Fact` seems a little outdated when it says that "_Put something false online and it will eventually be revealed as a lie_". This is not the case anymore. Today it's possible to create "alternative facts" using large amounts of network resources.
